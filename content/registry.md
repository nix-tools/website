The nix.tools Registry is a placeholder for a research project under construction.

The goal is to use the vanity domain as a prefix for distributed, remote resources, e.g.

```nix
{
  inputs.foo.url = "https://nix.tools/foo";
}
```

For more cutting-edge Nix research, see [The Ekala Project][ekala].
