[nix.tools][nix.tools] is an unofficial Nix documentation site and contains guides on how to enhance your Nix experience. It aims to supplement [nix.dev][nix.dev] with more tutorials and guides on more specific subjects. [nix.tools][nix.tools] aims to be to the Nix ecosystem what [baeldung.com][baeldung.com] is to the Java community: Well-researched guides to specific subjects, and generally educational.

## An alternative to the NixOS wikis

There are two competing NixOS wikis: [nixos.wiki][nixos.wiki] and [wiki.nixos.org][wiki.nixos.org] that currently diverge on content because the maintainers cannot agree to keep them in sync. Before that, the wiki was predictably: outdated, sometimes questionable, and irreplaceable at the same time.

While the NixOS wikis do not have the same standard as the Arch Wiki, [nix.tools][nix.tools] aims to be a curated list of high-quality articles on subjects related to Nix, but also stretching towards how to bootstrap software via Nix.

Wikis serve the purpose of offloading newly found experience in a very specific domain without needing to own a blog, or meet an editorial standard.

The motivation behind [nix.tools][nix.tools] was to keep the spirit of the wikis, to ensure high quality, and to avoid the confusion.

[nix.tools][nix.tools] is not just another personal blog: It welcomes articles from anyone who might be interested.
